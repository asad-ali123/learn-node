version

each version have three parts like 

5.1.0

first part -> 5
2nd part -> 1
3rd part -> 0


start from last

3rd part -->  minor fixes (optional.)
2nd part --> 5 recommended bug fix  (security fix)
first part --> major release  major and breaking updates 

now understand caret symbol (^)

if add this before version then its lock the major version like 
^5.1.0
its lock the 5 
when update the npm i then install all recommended and minor changes automatically 
which is the best thing 
^version compatible  with version
exmple 
^5.1.0
5.2.0
5.2.1
5.3.5
when release 6 version then not update the automatically  


if add ~ line then lock the recommended version just update the minor changes  automatically 
for example
~5.1.0
5.1.1
5.1.2
5.1.5
5.1.9

when release 5.2 version then not update the automatically
